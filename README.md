# Penguin 2.2.0 Dark

A minimalistic dark theme for [Ghost](https://ghost.org/). Based only on html and css to make it as lightweight as possible with the exception of [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) for any code blocks.

The main idea for the menu is to use tags as the links as well as for static pages or external urls.
